    "\n",
    "1. Dictionaries\n",
    "    - Dicts are key-value stores\n",
    "    - There are some rules for a dict\n",
    "        - Every key must be immutable\n",
    "        - Keys in a dict are unique\n",
    "        - Every key has a value, and every value has a key\n",
    "        - There are *no* restrictions on values; they can repeat, and can be any value we want or imagine\n",
    "    - We retrieve via `[]`, indicating the key whose value we want\n",
    "    - We can check if a key is in a dict with `in`\n",
    "        - We cannot use `in` to find if a value is in a dict\n",
    "    - We can assign to a dict using `[]`\n",
    "        - If the key is new, then we add a key-value pair\n",
    "        - If the key exists, then we update the value for that key\n",
    "    - We can iterate over a dict\n",
    "        - If we iterate over the dict object, we get the keys\n",
    "        - The `dict.items` method returns `(key, value)` 2-element tuples, one at a time, when we iterate. This is my favorite way to iterate over a dict\n",
    "    - Three paradigms for using dicts\n",
    "        - Dicts are always mutable -- but these are three conventions for working with them, that I've seen a lot of\n",
    "        - Define it, retrieve from it, but never update it -- use as a small in-memory database\n",
    "        - Define a dict with keys and initial values; we never add/remove keys, but we do update the values to count things\n",
    "        - Define an empty dict, adding keys (as needed) and values (as needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Files\n",
    "    - To work with a file, we need to use `open`, which requests help and a file object from the OS\n",
    "        - When we open a file, we can specify the \"mode\" as the second argument to `open`, after the filename\n",
    "            - `'r'` (reading, the default)\n",
    "            - `'w'` (writing, which removes any previous data / zeroes out the file we open if it exists)\n",
    "            - `'a'` (append, like writing, but adds to the end of a file)\n",
    "    - We can read from a file in at least three ways:\n",
    "        - Invoke `read()`, getting the contents, but this is considered a bit dangerous\n",
    "        - Invoke `read(n)`, which returns the next `n` characters, but this is annoying, because it doesn't stop at lines.\n",
    "        - Iterate over the file object, giving us one line at a time\n",
    "            - Each iteration returns a string, one line in the file\n",
    "            - Each line ends with `'\\n'`, the line-ending character\n",
    "            - When we get to the end of the file, the loop stops\n",
    "    - If we want to write to a file, we use the `write` method\n",
    "        - This doesn't automatically add `'\\n'` to the end\n",
    "    - The problem with writing is that you really need to flush + close the file, if you want to know precisely when the data is written to disk\n",
    "        - You can invoke one or both of these yourself\n",
    "            - `f.flush()` or `f.close()` will do these\n",
    "            - You can retrieve `f.closed`, which is a `True` or `False` value, indicating if the file was closed.\n",
    "        - It's common to use `with` to open a file-handling section of your code, and it automatically flushes + closes the file at the end of the block."
