    "    Loops\n",
    "        If you want to repeat some code, you can use a loop. Python has two loops, for and while.\n",
    "        for loops\n",
    "            Iterate a number of times over a sequence of values -- strings, lists, tuples, or ranges\n",
    "            The syntax of a for loop starts with for VARIABLE in VALUE, which means: I want to execute the loop body once for each element of VALUE. Each, in turn, will be assigned to VARIABLE.\n",
    "            At the end of the line, we put :\n",
    "            We then have an indented block, the \"loop body,\" which can contain any code we want, using the loop variable, which will have the current value.\n",
    "        while loops\n",
    "            These are sort of like if statements, in that the condition is evaluated at the start\n",
    "            If the condition is True, then the loop body executes\n",
    "            After the loop body executes, we then return to the while statement, which checks the condition once again.\n",
    "        When do we use each of these?\n",
    "            for loops are great for doing an action once for each value in a series\n",
    "            while loops are great if we don't know how many times we'll want to execute the loop body, but we know when we'll want to stop.\n",
    "        Controlling our loops\n",
    "            If we want to end the current iteration, continuing immediately with the next one (and ignoring the rest of the loop body), we can use the continue statement\n",
    "            If we want to end all iterations, and exit the loop right away, we can use the break statement\n",
    "            Both of these statements must be inside of a loop to work; outside of a loop body, you'll get an error message.\n",
    "        Looping a number of times\n",
    "            Because integers aren't iterable, we cannot say for count in 5.\n",
    "            Instead, we use the range builtin, which takes an integer.\n",
    "            We get that number of iterations, with values from 0 until (not including) the number we specified.\n",
    "            So range(5) will give us 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n",
    "            We can also say range(5, 10), which will give us 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n",
    "        If you want the index, use enumerate\n",
    "            If you iterate over enumerate('abcd'), each iteration will give you both the index (starting at 0) and the current element\n",
    "            enumerate returns a 2-element tuple with each iteration, (index, element), which we can capture with for index, one_item in enumerate('abcd').\n",
    "            Normally, though, we don't need the index, and Python loops just give us the elements themselves\n",
    "    Lists\n",
    "        Lists are a second data structure in the \"sequence\" family, along with strings and tuples\n",
    "        Lists are the main \"collection\" type in Python, containing other values.\n",
    "        A list can contain any number of values of any types, but it's traditional to just use lists to hold one type at a time.\n",
    "        We use [] to define lists and to retrieve from them\n",
    "            If we say [], that's the empty list\n",
    "            We can define a list as [10, 20, 30], which means -- a list of 3 integers\n",
    "            We can retrieve with [index] for one item\n",
    "            We can retrieve with [start:stop] for a slice\n",
    "            We can iterate over a list, getting one element at a time\n",
    "            We can search in a list with in\n",
    "        Lists are mutable! We can change them in numerous ways\n",
    "            Replace an element by assigning, as in mylist[3] = 123\n",
    "            Add a new element at the end with list.append, as in mylist.append(400)\n",
    "                Note: Do not put list.append on the right side of assignment! It'll give you None, not the list\n",
    "            Remove the final element with list.pop, as in mylist.pop().\n",
    "            Don't forget to invoke the methods with ()! Otherwise, things won't work\n",
    "    Splitting and joining\n",
    "        If we have a string, and that string contains a number of fields, we can get back a list of strings, using str.split\n",
    "            If we specify a string as an argument, it's used as a delimiter\n",
    "            If we don't specify any argument, then any whitespace (any character, any combination, any length) is used as the delimiter\n",
    "            The result is always a list of strings, no matter what.\n",
    "            s.split() -- doesn't modify s, and doesn't replace it; it's still a string. We get back a list that we can then iterate over, analyze, or assign to a variable.\n",
    "        If we have a list of strings, and want to get a new string back containing them, we can\n",
    "            We use str.join, invoking it on the string we want as the \"glue\" between elements\n",
    "            We get back a new string with those values\n",
    "            str.join only works on a list of strings, not a list of ints or other types\n",
    "    Tuples\n",
    "        Tuples are also sequences -- they are immutable (like strings) but can contain anything (like lists)\n",
    "        Tuples are typically used for collections of values that are different\n",
    "            When we invoke a function, the arguments are passed in a tuple\n",
    "            When we retrieve from a database, we'll get each record as a tuple\n",
    "            Tuples are basically for records/structs in Python\n",
    "        We create tuples with (), but retrieve with [], just like strings and lists\n",
    "        The most day-to-day use for tuples will be \"tuple unpacking,\" where we ask Python to assign elements of a sequence to a number of variables:\n",
    "            x,y,z = [10, 20, 30]\n",
