    "Soon after this happened, people invented *general-purpose* computers that could be used to solve many different problems. You would solve those problems by describing what you wanted using 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon after that, people invented programming languages, where you would write in a form that's easier for people, and then that would be translated into 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are now hundreds of thousands of different programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "- C and C++ -- these are \"low-level languages,\" where you have to think like the computer. The advantage is that they execute very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java and C# -- these are medium-level languages, where you have to think somewhat like the computer, and the execution speed is almost as good as C/C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python, JavaScript, Perl, Ruby are high-level languages where it's as close as we can come to human language, but then they tend to execute slowly.\n",

    "3. At the end of the `if` line, we must have a `:`. If you don't have it there, Python will complain. The `:` means: The next part of the program has a block.\n",
    "4. A \"block\" in Python is an indented set of lines. In this case, the block following `if` only executes if the condition that `if` got is `True`.\n",
    "5. Indentation is the way that we know a block starts and ends in Python. We don't use `{}` or `begin`/`end`, or other systems. You must use indentation. Traditionally, we use 4 spaces for each level of indentation. Realistically, you should just let Jupyter (or your Python editor) decide for you.\n",
    "6. A block can contain *any* number of lines (at least one). When the indentation ends (thanks to using backspace), the block ends.\n",
    "7. We can optionally have an `else` clause. It, like `if`, has a `:` at the end of the line, and then an indented block with one or more lines.\n",
    "8. Either `if` or `else` is guaranteed to fire -- it cannot be both of them, and it cannot be neither of them. One, and only one, will run.\n",
