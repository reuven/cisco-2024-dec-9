    "Soon after that, people invented programming languages, where you would write in a form that's easier for people, and then that would be translated into 1s and 0s.\n",

    "There are now hundreds of thousands of different programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "- C and C++ -- these are \"low-level languages,\" where you have to think like the computer. The advantage is that they execute very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java and C# -- these are medium-level languages, where you have to think somewhat like the computer, and the execution speed is almost as good as C/C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python, JavaScript, Perl, Ruby are high-level languages where it's as close as we can come to human language, but then they tend to execute slowly.\n",

    "3. At the end of the `if` line, we must have a `:`. If you don't have it there, Python will complain. The `:` means: The next part of the program has a block.\n",
    "4. A \"block\" in Python is an indented set of lines. In this case, the block following `if` only executes if the condition that `if` got is `True`.\n",
    "5. Indentation is the way that we know a block starts and ends in Python. We don't use `{}` or `begin`/`end`, or other systems. You must use indentation. Traditionally, we use 4 spaces for each level of indentation. Realistically, you should just let Jupyter (or your Python editor) decide for you.\n",
    "6. A block can contain *any* number of lines (at least one). When the indentation ends (thanks to using backspace), the block ends.\n",
    "7. We can optionally have an `else` clause. It, like `if`, has a `:` at the end of the line, and then an indented block with one or more lines.\n",
    "8. Either `if` or `else` is guaranteed to fire -- it cannot be both of them, and it cannot be neither of them. One, and only one, will run.\n",
