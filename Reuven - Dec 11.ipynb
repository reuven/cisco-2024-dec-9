    "1. Loops\n",
    "    - If you want to repeat some code, you can use a loop. Python has two loops, `for` and `while`.\n",
    "    - `for` loops\n",
    "        - Iterate a number of times over a sequence of values -- strings, lists, tuples, or ranges\n",
    "        - The syntax of a `for` loop starts with `for VARIABLE in VALUE`, which means: I want to execute the loop body once for each element of `VALUE`. Each, in turn, will be assigned to `VARIABLE`.\n",
    "        - At the end of the line, we put `:`\n",
    "        - We then have an indented block, the \"loop body,\" which can contain *any* code we want, using the loop variable, which will have the current value.\n",
    "    - `while` loops\n",
    "        - These are sort of like `if` statements, in that the condition is evaluated at the start\n",
    "        - If the condition is `True`, then the loop body executes\n",
    "        - After the loop body executes, we then return to the `while` statement, which checks the condition once again.\n",
    "    - When do we use each of these?\n",
    "        - `for` loops are great for doing an action once for each value in a series\n",
    "        - `while` loops are great if we don't know how many times we'll want to execute the loop body, but we know when we'll want to stop.\n",
    "    - Controlling our loops\n",
    "        - If we want to end the current iteration, continuing immediately with the next one (and ignoring the rest of the loop body), we can use the `continue` statement\n",
    "        - If we want to end all iterations, and exit the loop right away, we can use the `break` statement\n",
    "        - Both of these statements must be inside of a loop to work; outside of a loop body, you'll get an error message.\n",
    "    - Looping a number of times\n",
    "        - Because integers aren't iterable, we cannot say `for count in 5`.\n",
    "        - Instead, we use the `range` builtin, which takes an integer.\n",
    "        - We get that number of iterations, with values from 0 until (not including) the number we specified.\n",
    "        - So `range(5)` will give us 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n",
    "        - We can also say `range(5, 10)`, which will give us 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n",
    "2. Lists\n",
    "3. Splitting and joining\n",
    "4. Tuples"
