    "# Recap from yesterday\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python works with values\n",
    "    - Every value has a different type\n",
    "    - We can ask its type with the `type` function\n",
    "    - We can assign a value to a variable (an alias or pronoun that refers to it) with `=`, the assignment operator\n",
    "        - When we assign, the right side executes before the left side\n",
    "        - The first time we assign to a variable, the variable is created\n",
    "        - Subsequent assignments give a new value to the variable, and remove any connection to the previous value\n",
    "        - Variable names are traditionally all in lowercase with `_` between words. You can use `_` and digits as well as letters, but not at the start and (you shouldn't) use `_` at the end, either.\n",
    "    - Basic functions\n",
    "        - `print` displays a value on the screen\n",
    "        - `input` asks the user for input, and returns whatever they typed as a string\n",
    "    - Comparison operators\n",
    "        - We can compare any two values in Python with a comparison operator, which returns `True` or `False`, depending on the comparison\n",
    "            - `==` (equality)\n",
    "            - `!=` (inequality)\n",
    "            - `<`\n",
    "            - `<=`\n",
    "            - `>`\n",
    "            - `>=`\n",
    "    - Conditional execution\n",
    "        - We can make code only run sometimes with `if`. \n",
    "            - To the right of `if`, we need a `True` or `False` value\n",
    "            - If the expression is `True`, then the indented block immediately after the `if` is executed\n",
    "            - If it's `False`, and if there's an `else` block, then that is executed instead.\n",
    "            - We can have multiple conditions with `if`/`elif`/`else`. Note that `if` and `elif` both have conditions, whereas `else` doesn't.\n",
    "2. Numbers\n",
    "    - Python has two types of numbers (like the chips on which our computers run)\n",
    "        - Integers -- whole numbers, only digits\n",
    "        - Floats -- numbers with a decimal point and a fractional part (which can be 0)\n",
    "    - We can use standard operators on our numbers -- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (truediv), `//` (floordiv), `**` (exponentiation), `%` (modulo)\n",
    "    - We can assign any number we want to a variable\n",
    "        - To add to that number, we can use `x = x + 1` or `x += 1`\n",
    "            - Every operator has this sort of shortcut operator, e.g., `x -= 1` and `x *= 5`\n",
    "            \n",
