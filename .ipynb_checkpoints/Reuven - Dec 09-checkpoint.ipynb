    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "When computers were invented, each computer solved a specific problem. If you have a new problem, you need a new computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon after this happened, people invented *general-purpose* computers that could be used to solve many different problems. You would solve those problems by describing what you wanted using 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon after that, people invented programming languages, where you would write in a form that's easier for people, and then that would be translated into 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are now hundreds of thousands of different programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "- C and C++ -- these are \"low-level languages,\" where you have to think like the computer. The advantage is that they execute very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java and C# -- these are medium-level languages, where you have to think somewhat like the computer, and the execution speed is almost as good as C/C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python, JavaScript, Perl, Ruby are high-level languages where it's as close as we can come to human language, but then they tend to execute slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed more than 30 years ago to be a high-level language that stresses readability, but gives you all of the power of any other language. \n",

    "# What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm typing into Jupyter, and specifically the Jupyter Notebook, which is a very popular environment for using Python. (Especially with data scientists.) The idea is that you can have code + documentation + data + plots all in the same place. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, it's great because you can use your browser and run Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter works with \"cells.\" I'm currently typing into a cell. When you type into a cell, one of two things can happen, depending on the mode: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Edit mode means that typing enters text into the cell (like now). You can enter edit mode with `ENTER` or clicking inside of the cell.\n",
    "- Command mode means that you type a letter, and Jupyter interprets it as a command. You can enter command mode by pressing `ESC` or clicking to the left of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What commands do we have in \"command mode\"?\n",
    "- `c` -- copy the current cell\n",
    "- `x` -- cut the current cell\n",
    "- `v` -- paste the most recently cut/copied cell\n",
    "- `a` -- add a new cell *above* the current one\n",
    "- `b` -- add a new cell *below* the current one\n",
    "- `y` -- make the cell in Python\n",
    "- `m` -- make the cell contain documentation in Markdown \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to \"execute\" the cell, meaning (a) make the documentation look nice or (b) execute the Python code in it, then use shift + `ENTER` together."
