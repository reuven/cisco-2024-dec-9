    "\n",
    "When computers were invented, each computer solved a specific problem. If you have a new problem, you need a new computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon after this happened, people invented *general-purpose* computers that could be used to solve many different problems. You would solve those problems by describing what you wanted using 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon after that, people invented programming languages, where you would write in a form that's easier for people, and then that would be translated into 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are now hundreds of thousands of different programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "- C and C++ -- these are \"low-level languages,\" where you have to think like the computer. The advantage is that they execute very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java and C# -- these are medium-level languages, where you have to think somewhat like the computer, and the execution speed is almost as good as C/C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python, JavaScript, Perl, Ruby are high-level languages where it's as close as we can come to human language, but then they tend to execute slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed more than 30 years ago to be a high-level language that stresses readability, but gives you all of the power of any other language. \n",
